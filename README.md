## README: JSON API Tester

### Overview
This application provides a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to send HTTP GET requests to a specified API and view the formatted JSON responses. It is designed to help developers and testers interact with APIs without the need for command-line tools or additional API testing software. The application supports dynamic query inputs, copy and save functionalities for the responses, enhancing productivity during the development and testing phases.

### Requirements
- **Python**: The application is written in Python and requires Python 3.x.
- **Libraries**:
  - `tkinter` for the GUI.
  - `requests` for making HTTP requests.
  - `json` for JSON parsing and formatting.

### Installation
#### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install requests
```
Note: `tkinter` usually comes pre-installed with Python. If it's not installed, you can find installation instructions based on your operating system.

### Usage
#### Running the Application
Navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:
```bash
python json_api_tester.py
```
Replace `json_api_tester.py` with the name of your script if different.

#### Interface Description
- **Query Input**: A text field where you can enter the query parameters for the API call.
- **Perform Request Button**: Executes the API call with the specified query parameters and displays the formatted JSON response in the text area below.
- **Text Area**: A scrollable display for the JSON response. Users can select and right-click to copy text from this area.
- **Save Button**: Allows users to save the displayed JSON response to a text file.

### Features
- **Dynamic Query Input**: Users can input any query string to modify the API call.
- **Formatted JSON Display**: JSON responses are pretty-printed in the scrollable text area.
- **Copy Functionality**: Users can copy text directly from the JSON display using a right-click context menu.
- **Save Functionality**: Users can save the JSON response to a file for later use or external analysis.

### Troubleshooting
#### Common Issues
- **Connection Errors**: Ensure the API server is running and accessible from your machine. Check the URL and network settings.
- **JSON Parsing Errors**: If the server response is not valid JSON, the application will show an error message. Verify the server's response format.
- **Library Not Found**: If you receive an error regarding missing libraries, ensure that all required Python packages are installed as per the installation instructions.
